# DTMF-Controlled-Rescue-Robot
DTMF stands for Dual Tone â€“ Multi Frequency and it is the basis for your telephone system. DTMF is actually the generic term for Touch-Tone. Here a phone is attached to a DTMF decoder module MT8870 interfaced with AtMega8 microcontroller with PORTD as input and PORTC as output connected to L293D motor driver IC that drives locomotion motor of the robot. AtMega 8 development board is designed and printed using photo-lithography. When we call the number of  phone on the bot, it is automatically answered as the phone is on auto answer mode, When we press 1 on the keypad, the bot moves left, 2 for right, 3 for back and 4 for forward. Pressing any other key will stop the robot. Improvisation can also be made to interface any other arm or conveyor belt to any other key on 4X4 dialpad.
